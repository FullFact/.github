### Context
<!--
  Give a high-level overview to put the research question in
  context and explain why the answer is needed. There should be 
  enough detail for anyone to pick up this ticket and understand 
  the topic of research proposed. If the answer will be some new
  code, consider raising a feature request instead.
-->



### Resarch Question(s)
<!--
  Ask an explicit research question. If there's more than one
  closely related questions, make it a list.

  Consider the scope of the question: too broad a question may
  need a lot of effort to answer thoroughly, but too narrow may
  not produce useful, general answers.
  
  What should the answer look like? Will it be a single fact or
  a document, a spreadsheet, a graph? Who is the intended 
  audience? Should the answer be exact and precise or is a
  quick "ballpark" answer enough? 
  
  A clear question will save wasted effort.
